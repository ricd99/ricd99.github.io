        I built this in Outsystems, a low-code development platform. I thought
        that experimenting with low-code software would be a nice introduction
        into "real" coding. I was wrong.

                  section is draggable; you can dynamically resize the two
                  sections.

                <li>
                  To create a task, click on the empty space in the Active Tasks

            I wanted to try out a low-code platform because I believed the
            growth of AI meant low-code technologies would become more relevant.
            I don't know how true that is, so if you have any insights on this
            please do tell me.
          </li>
          <li>
            In terms of using Outsystems as a entry point to "real coding", that
            did not work. When you use low-code technologies, a lot of the work
            is done behind the scenes. This is no problem (and probably very
            convienient) for expereinced developers, but for people like me who
            are trying to learn, this is counterproductive.
          </li>
          <li>
            I often found myself blindly following online tutorials when
            building this app. That's not going to help me learn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lesson learned: start with "real coding": python, javascript, learn
            DSA, etc. We may be living through a time of rapid change, but that
            doesn't change the fact that knowing the fundamentals is essential.
